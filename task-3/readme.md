# Task 3

This week's tasks are listed below. 

1. Install Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) in a Virtual machine or docker conatainer
2. Find all the SQL injection and Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability occurences


ðŸ‘‰ Fork the repository from here  https://github.com/gtechatfg/mulearn-cybersecurity-cohort1

ðŸ‘‰ In directory task-3 you can find a sample PDF report under team-0 named sample-report.pdf.

ðŸ‘‰ Create a PDF report with a short description about the vulnerability and how to mitigate it; use the sample report as a reference

ðŸ‘‰ Push the PDF report to GitHub in such a way that each team has its own sub-directory inside task-3 directory just like the previous task; otherwise, it will not be accepted

ðŸ‘‰ Make a pull request to the source repository; we will use this pull request to evaluate your report.


Task points will be assigned based on the report's readability; it is preferable if every team member contributes. Because this is a group activity, it would be better if you could collaborate by meeting in person or virtually for a better outcome.

**The deadline for submitting the task is 24-july-2022, 11:59 PM. IST**

You can also post images of your group meetups here.
